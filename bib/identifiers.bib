	abstract = {A Uniform Resource Identifier ({URI}) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. This specification defines the generic {URI} syntax and a process for resolving {URI} references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of {URIs} on the Internet. The {URI} syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid {URIs}, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a {URI} reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for {URIs}; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each {URI} scheme. [{STANDARDS}-{TRACK}]},
