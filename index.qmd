# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Reprex's new OpenCollections system wants to help small and large enterprises work with big data without huge investments into data infrastructure. OpenCollections is a collaborative tool that enables owners of small, local databases to remain competitive in training or AI in the age of big data. It helps to fill your databases with up-to-date information, find and correct errors in your databases, and connect your database entries to new information as you need them without further IT and data investments.

OpenCollections aims to link various open, public, and private databases and let the knowledge flow among them. OpenCollections is not a database system but a knowledge system that helps to fill up databases with the latest information, find errors in private databases, or support the human-in-the-loop process of overseeing what AI systems are doing on your behalf or perhaps against you.

OpenCollections is built around Wikibase, the open-source knowledge management system that was originally developed to maintain the world's most extensive open knowledge graph, Wikidata. Wikidata evolved into a central hub on the web otf data and it is one of the largest existing knowlege graphs, and perhaps the best known open one. It is synchronised with knowledge from respected public institutions like Eurostat, the German National Library or BBC, and it is one of the backbones of many web services like Google Search. Wikibase *is scalable* to very big graphs, and it has many thousand users with a simple and intuitive user interface.

We are augmenting Wikibase with further software components developed by Reprex that allow its smooth operation in various institutional and enterprise settings. The choice of Wikibase as a core components allows an easy onboarding; and knowledge coordination teams can easily find new colleagues, tutorials, and help with the globally known Wikidata/Wikibase interface. See @sec-getting-started-wikidata to get started. The creation of OpenCollection accounts is explained step-by-step in @sec-opencollections-create-account.

While OpenCollections is almost exclusively built from open-source components and taps into various open knowledge systems, it was not designed to work only with open data; in fact, its primary use is to improve the quality of proprietary, often very confidential, and protected databases. Such databases usually need authoritative data from statistical agencies, scientific bodies, or governmental registries; connecting your systems with open knowledge graphs can ensure that such data is imported without delay and error into your systems. Similarly, you may need to inform the world about your copyright-protected repertoire or the technical details of your product offering. Placing the information on global knowledge graphs ensures that thousands of web services will effortlessly use the updated, new, or correct information about your offering.
