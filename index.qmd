# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Reprex's new `OpenCollections` system wants to help small and large enterprises work with big data without huge investments into data infrastructure. `OpenCollections` is a collaborative tool that enables owners of small, local databases to remain competitive in training AI in the age of big data. It helps to fill your databases with up-to-date information, find and correct errors in your databases, and connect your database entries to new information as you need them without further IT and data investments.

`OpenCollections` aims to link various open, public, and private databases and let the knowledge flow among them. `OpenCollections` is not a database system but a knowledge system that helps to fill up databases with the latest information, find errors in private databases, or support the human-in-the-loop process of overseeing what AI systems are doing on your behalf or perhaps against you.

The `Open Music Observatory` and its music data-sharing space utilised Reprex's `OpenCollections` system for data coordination, terminology negotiation, and import.

Like many applications in the European open data field, `OpenCollections` is built around Wikibase. This open-source software system has built one of the world's most extensive knowledge graphs and knowledge bases, Wikidata, which synchronises the knowledge base of the 329 versions of Wikipedia.

Wikibase has been successfully used in many EU projects, including the creation of the [EU Knowledge Graphâ†—](https://linkedopendata.eu/wiki/The_EU_Knowledge_Graph) (see: @sec-eu-knowledge-graph, [@diefenbach_wikibase_2021]). It also has training material on the EU Academy. While Wikibase is fully open-source and accessible, it is a complicated system that requires many extensions and adoptions to support a data-sharing space or a public-private knowledge base like ours. Reprex's extensions aim to make data importing and enrichment easier and less costly and make data export more reusable. The Open Music Observatory is not dependent on Reprex's extensions; however, our dataspace's automated and semi-automated data-sharing workflows use `OpenCollections` to speed up the process or the unit-testing of the imports.

Using Wikibase allows coordination with Wikidata, which evolved into a central hub on the web of data and it is one of the largest existing knowledge graphs, and perhaps the best known open one. It is synchronised with knowledge from respected public institutions like Eurostat, the German National Library or BBC, and it is one of the backbones of many web services like Google Search. Wikibase *is scalable* to very big graphs, and it has many thousands users with a simple and intuitive user interface.

We are augmenting Wikibase with further software components developed by Reprex that allow its smooth operation in various institutional and enterprise settings. Wikibase as a core component allows an easy onboarding; furthermore, knowledge coordination teams can easily find new colleagues and tutorials and help with the globally known Wikidata/Wikibase interface. See @sec-getting-started-wikidata to get started. The creation of `OpenCollections` accounts is explained step-by-step in @sec-opencollections-create-account.

While `OpenCollections` is almost exclusively built from open-source components and taps into various open knowledge systems, it was not designed to work only with open data; in fact, its primary use is to improve the quality of proprietary, often very confidential, and protected databases. Such databases usually need authoritative data from statistical agencies, scientific bodies, or governmental registries; connecting your systems with open knowledge graphs can ensure that such data is imported without delay and error into your systems. Similarly, you may need to inform the world about your copyright-protected repertoire or the technical details of your product offering. Placing the information on global knowledge graphs ensures that thousands of web services will effortlessly use the updated, new, or correct information about your offering.
