# Question Bank Items In Wikibase {#sec-questionbank .appendix}

DDI-Lifecycle is not yet available in RDF. Some elements of DDI are standardised; others are not. Whenever possible, we use the standardised vocabulary and annotation; when no such ontology is present, we create our interpretation of DDI.

DDI organises questions into 3+1 hierarchical levels.

-   [x] `QuestionItem`: the concept being measured by the question, text for the question, response domain information, clarifying instructions, external aids (clarifying objects used in presenting the question to the respondent), Input and Output Parameters and Bindings, allowed response cardinality and estimation of the time required to respond.

-   [x] `QuestionBlock`: This structure is intended to bundle together a set of questions (items and/or grids) that have meaning only about a specified object expressed as the evaluation material. This form of question set is common in educational testing where a text, image, or other material is provided, and the respondent is asked questions specific to the material. For example, a portion of a play script is provided, and the respondent is asked questions concerning the dialogue and/or stage directions provided in the script. Note that the intent of QuestionBlock is not to bundle together a set of questions that are commonly used together or used in a specified order.

-   [x] `QuestionGroup` is only for administrative purposes.

## Model question

A [model question](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q126) is a question template that can create simple questions or question items in question grids or blocks.

-   URI: [Q127](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q127)
-   label: `Trust in EU ECOLABEL [model]`
-   questionText (description): `Please tell me to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I trust that products carrying the EU ecolabel are environmentally-friendly.” [ ] scale`

And a question based on a model question, taken from

-   QID: <https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q111>

-   label: `Trust in EU ECOLABEL`

-   questionText (description): `Please tell me to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statement:` `“I trust that products carrying the EU ecolabel are environmentally-friendly.”` `[ ] Totally agree [ ], Tend to agree [ ], Tend to disagree [ ], Totally disagree [ ], DK`

-   variable representation: [scale representation base type](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q116)

-   study (DDI): [Eurobarometer 88.1 (2017)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q139)

Our model questions follow the following format:

-   `questionText (description)`, `[ ]` `concept`, where the question connects to a concept, such as [environmental protection (Q131)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q131).
-   `questionText (description)`, `[ ]` `scale`, where the answers are on a scale, for example [Estimated number of employees in FTE \[model\] (Q123)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q123)
-   `questionText (description)`, `[ ]` `category`, where the answer options are categories, for example: [Reduced use of single use plastic bags \[model\] (Q112)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q112)
-   `questionText (description)`, `[ ]` `ranking`, where the respondent has to create a rank from the answer options, for example: [Important environmental issue \[model\] (Q143)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q143)
-   `questionText (description)`, `[ ]` `concept,` `[ ] scale,` where beside the model question there are other sub-questions as well, for example: [Important for reduction of plastic \[model\] (Q128)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q128)

The DDI-Discovery ontology requires the questions to take this format:

> *Please tell me to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I trust that products carrying the EU ecolabel are environmentally-friendly.” \[ \], Agree \[ \], \[ \], Disagree \[ \], DK*

This is a good representation to for an existing questionnaire, but it is not really good for a questionbank, because in some cases, the agreement scale may be a 3-level, in others, a 5-level agreement scale. This is why we separately record the model question, the subquestions and the answer options.

### Question properties

-   [variable representation (P265)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P265): a DDI-Lifecycle category for the creation of variables from the answer options, for example,

-   [related survey concept (P267)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P267): a concept that a study (group), question (group) or question item aims to measure, for example [environmental protection (Q131)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q131).

-   [study (DDI) P270](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P270): the *study* where you can find this (model) question (item). In DDI, a study represents the process by which a data set was generated or collected (in a survey). For example, [Eurobarometer 88.1 (2017) Q139](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q139)

## Example

### 2. Create a New Question Item

Different question types have different elements. Some questions consist of one question, others have group questions and several sub-questions. Let's see how to feed into Wikibase:

-   Simple Questions

<!-- -->

-   Matrix Questions

-   Multiple Choice Questions

#### Simple Questions

In case of Simple Questions there's only one question.

::: callout-note
## For a clearer definition, see the disco:Question class
:::

![](png/question_to_wikibase/question_simple_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Let's see how to create a simple question entry in Wikibase. Go to "Special Pages"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikidata_specialPages_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Scroll down and select: "Create a New Item"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikibase_addNewItem_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Fill the form with the question's data:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)

-   Label - Give a short name for the question

-   Description - Enter the question itself in the format specified above.

-   Aliases - leave it empty

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikibase_createNewItem_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Click `Create`.

The question now is created on Wikibase.

![](png/question_to_wikibase/example_question_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: callout-note
Note: The system assigns a unique ID to every entry. In our example the ID is [Q111](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q111).
:::

#### Matrix Questions

Matrix questions have:

-   a model question

-   several question items

-   answer options

![](png/question_to_wikibase/matrix_question.png){fig-align="center"}

Following the functions "Special Pages" -\> "Create New Item" you should feed into Wibikbase separately the model question and the questions items.

[Q128](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q128) is the model question, which follows the structure:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)

-   Label - *questionName + \[model\]* - `Important for reduction of plastic [model]` 

-   questionText (description)

    -   `In your opinion, how important is each of the following in reducing plastic waste and littering?`

    -   `[ ]` `concept` - stands for the question items

    -   `[ ]` `scale` - stands for the answer options, which follow a scale

-   Aliases - leave it empty

[Q140](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q140) is a sub-questions, which follows the structure:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)
-   label: `Important for reduction of plastic - collection facilities`
-   questionText (description)
    -   model question - `In your opinion, how important is each of the following in reducing plastic waste and littering?`
    -   question item: `[ ] Local authorities should provide more and better collection facilities for plastic waste`
    -   `[ ]` `scale` - stands for the answer options, which follow a scale
-   Aliases - leave it empty

::: callout-note
## When creating a "question item", using statements always connect the "question item" to the "model question"
:::

#### Multiple Choice Questions

Matrix questions have:

-   a model question

-   several question items

![](png/question_to_wikibase/question_multipleChoice_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

Following the functions "Special Pages" -\> "Create New Item" you should feed into Wibikbase separately the model question and the questions items.

[Q143](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q143) is the model question, which follows the structure:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)

-   Label - *questionName + \[model\]* - ``` Important environmental issue``[model] ``` 

-   questionText (description)

    -   `From the following list, please pick the four environmental issues which you consider the most important.`

    -   `[ ] ranking` - stands for the question items

-   Aliases - leave it empty

[Q144](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q144) is a question item, which follows the structure:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)
-   label: `Important for reduction of plastic - collection facilities`
-   questionText (description)
    -   model question - `From the following list, please pick the four environmental issues which you consider the most important.`
    -   question item - `[ ] Decline or extinction of species and habitats, and of natural ecosystems (forests, fertile soils)`
-   Aliases - leave it empty

::: callout-note
## When creating a "question item", using statements always connect the "question item" to the "model question"
:::

### 3. Add Metadata Statements

You need to add further metadata statements to the question bank item. Metadata is a statement about the data. We are adding standard, basic statements in subject, predicate, and object (triplet) format to each question bank item.

#### Questionnaire Classes

Let's start by specifying the entry we created as a `question`, `model question` or `question item`.

Select `+add statement`.

![](png/question_to_wikibase/addStatement_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Using the [instance of](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P2) property, which is defining the taxonomical class of the entered item (in this case, a question.)

In case of simple questions, with one questions define them as "`questions`".

![](png/question_to_wikibase/statement_property_and_class_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

In case of multiple questions (matrix, multiple choice) define your `model questions` and the `question items`, then accordingly categorize them with the [instance of](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P2) property.

::: callout-caution
## In the case of questions items, always link them to the appropriate model questions using the [model question (P266)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P266) property.
:::

#### Variable Representation

When the questionnaire will be filled out in a raw dataset, each response of a question(item) will be translated into a variable. We need to define how we want to represent those answers in the resulting output dataset. (See [DDI 3.3 (2020) documentation - Variable Value Representation and Question Response Domain](https://ddi-lifecycle-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TechnicalGuide/Value%20Representation%20and%20Response%20Domain.html))

Using statements you can define the representation of the variables. You can choose from the following categories:

-   [x] category representation base type: if the answers are categories (for example: `[ ] Female`, `[ ] Male`, `[ ] Prefer not to say`)

-   [x] category representation base type with a **scale**: if the answers are categories and follow a scale (for example: `[] Very important`, `[ ] Fairly important`, `[ ] Not very important`, `[ ] Not at all important`. )

-   [x] ranking representation base type: the respondant must rank the answer options, like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.

-   [x] numeric variable representation base type: the answer should be a number, for example, the age of the respondant as an integer number or a postal code in a country where postal codes contain only numeric digits, f.e., `1051`.

-   [x] textual variable representation base type: the answer should be some text, for example, and open answer, or a geographical location typed as a simple text, for example, `Bratislava`.

#### Define the source study

::: callout-tip
For further details, please check the [disco:Study](https://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery.html#study) class.
:::

With the [study (DDI) P270](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P270) property you must link as a statement the *study* where you found the (model) question (item).

![](png/question_to_wikibase/statement_study_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

An example for a study: [Eurobarometer 88.1 (2017) Q139](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q139)

::: callout-note
Note: If the study is not yet in Wikibase, you can create an entry for it using the `Create a New Item` function.
:::

#### Add related concept

With the [related survey concept (P267)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P267) property you can link concepts, that a study (group), question (group) or question item aims to measure, for example [environmental protection (Q131)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q131).

![](png/question_to_wikibase/statement_relatedSurveyConcept_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Where are the related concepts coming from?

1\. The best case is that you use a widely accepted conceptualisation (ontology item) of your domain. For example, we took the [study (Q149)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q138) concept from the DDI-Discovery (disco) ontology. You can connect statements of equivalence to a well-defined ontology via [equivalent class (P69)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P69). In other words, our Q149 entity is equivalent to DDI's `Study`.

2\. If there are no accepted ontologies or you are uncertain, it is a very good practice to use a concept definition from Wikidata. Even in the case of an ontological definition, adding the Wikidata QID is a great idea because Wikidata connects equivalent definitions across various domains' ontologies. You can make a statement about an equivalent Wikidata URI (for an item) by [Wikibase URI (P73)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P73). See, for example [plastic (Q148)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q148), [Wikibase URI (P73)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Property:P73), <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11474>, meaning that our `plastic` definition is equivalent to the Wikidata definition of `plastic`.

3\. You can create your definition if you are still looking for a suitable definition in an accepted ontology or on Wikidata. For this, you should create a definition in Wikibase (as a new item.) See, for example, [model question (Q126)](https://reprexbase.eu/demowiki/index.php?title=Item:Q126), which is our own proprietary definition until we find a more consensual one.

### Add the questionText translations

On Wikibase you can add different language versions to the same question.

To do so, go to "Special Pages"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikidata_specialPages_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Scroll down and select: "Set Item/Property Description"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/SpecialPages_Set_ItemProperty_Description_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Fill the form:

-   ID - The QiD of the question

-   Language code - the new language you want to input the question

-   Description - The question itself in the new language

![](png/question_to_wikibase/Set_IetmProperty_Description_2x1.png){fig-align="center"} Select "Set Description".

The entry is now updated with another language.
