# How to feed questions into Wikibase

## 1. Get the question in the right format

The questions should be in the following format:

`Question?`

`+ [ ], Answer(1)`

`+ [ ], Answer(2)`

`+ ... +`

`+ [ ], Answer(N)`

> Example:
>
> *Please tell me to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I trust that products carrying the EU ecolabel are environmentally-friendly.” \[ \], Totally agree \[ \], Tend to agree \[ \], Tend to disagree \[ \], Totally disagree \[ \], DK*

::: callout-note
Note: There should be a space between the square brackets \["space"\]
:::

## 2. Access Wikibase

Login in with you account to Wikibase.

## 3. Create a new Question

Go to "Special Pages"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikidata_specialPages_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Scroll down and select: "Create a New Item"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikibase_addNewItem_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Fill the form with the question's data:

-   Language - Choose the language (en)

-   Label - Give a short name for the question

-   Description - Enter the question itself in the format specified above.

-   Aliases - leave it empty

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikibase_createNewItem_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Click "Create".

The question now is created on Wikibase.

::: callout-note
Note: The system assigns a uniqe ID to every entry. In our example the ID is Q111
:::

## 3. Add a statement

With statements you can provide additional information to your entry.

## Question types

Let's start by specifying the entry we created as a question.

Select "+add statement".

![](png/question_to_wikibase/addStatement_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Using the "instance of" property, define the entry as a question.

![](png/question_to_wikibase/statement_property_and_class_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Types of questions:

-   question:

### Matrix Questions

In case of a matrix question, use the concept of model questions and question items.

-   model question: a harmonised question that may be altered with different qualifiers, or connected to different concepts

-   question item: a harmonised question that may be altered with different qualifiers, or connected to different concepts

![](png/question_to_wikibase/matrix_question.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Model Question

Create the Model Question with the "Create a new Item" function.

![](png/question_to_wikibase/model_question_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

The model question should be in the following format:

`Model Question text`

`+ [ ] Item` - symbolizing the question items

`+ [ ] Scale` - symbolizing the answer options

> Example:
>
> *In your opinion, how important is each of the following in reducing plastic waste and littering? \[ \] item \[ \] scale*

::: callout-note
Note: When defining the model question's name (label) add "\[model\]" to the end of the name.
:::

Next, create an "instance of" statement to the group "model questions".

**Variable Representation**

Using statements you can define the representation of the variables. You can choose from the following categories:

-   category representation base type: if the answers are categories (for example: Female, Male, Prefer not to say)

-   category representation base type with a scale: if the answers are categories and follow a scale (for example: Very important - Fairly important - Not very important - Not at all important)

-   ranking representation base type: if the answers should be ranked

-   numeric variable representation base type: if the answer should be a number

-   textual variable representation base type: if the answer should be some text

![](png/question_to_wikibase/VariableRepresentation_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Question Item

Now you can create entries for all the question items from the matrix question, using the "Create a New Item" function.

![](png/question_to_wikibase/question_Item_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

## 4 Define the question in other languages as well

On Wikibase you can add different language versions to the same question.

To do so, go to "Special Pages"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/wikidata_specialPages_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Scroll down and select: "Set Item/Property Description"

![](png/question_to_wikibase/SpecialPages_Set_ItemProperty_Description_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Fill the form:

ID - The QiD of the question

Language code - the new language you want to input the question

Description - The question itself in the new language

![](png/question_to_wikibase/Set_IetmProperty_Description_2x1.png){fig-align="center"} Select "Set Description".

The entry is now updated with another language.
